Assertion Vs Normal Error Handling
Assertions are mainly used to check logically impossible situations. For example, they can be used to check the state a code expects before it starts running or state after it finishes running. Unlike normal error handling, assertions are generally disabled at run-time. Therefore, it is not a good idea to write statements in assert() that can cause side effects. 

#include <stdio.h>
#include <assert.h>
  
int main()
{
    int x = 7;
  
    /*  Some big code in between and let's say x 
       is accidentally changed to 9  */
    x = 9;
  
    // Programmer assumes x to be 7 in rest of the code
    assert(x==7);
  
    /* Rest of the code */
  
    return 0;
}
