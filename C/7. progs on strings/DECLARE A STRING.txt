// string cannot be copied by = operator 
//scanf reads input until it encounters whitespace whereas gets reads input until it encounters new line
//The problem with the scanf function is that it never reads an entire string. It will halt the reading process as soon as whitespace, form feed, vertical tab, newline or a carriage return occurs.
