. jdk = java development kit 
.javac (jdk)  converts .java text files to binary 
. you get a binary file for every .java file >>> class ( is like an idea in a programming language )
. binary file extension = .class 
. you may have more than one class in a java file  
. jvm = java virtual machine ( kind of extra layer on your existing computer )
.the binary file runs in jvm and not on your same computer 
.java>new project>name >next >finish>>class.....
