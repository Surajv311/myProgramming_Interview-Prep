/*

try to think of heap whenever smallest/largest asked in question...
use min heap to get ~largest ... and max heap for ~smallest...

--------------------------------------------------------

 Return K largest Elements in array

 Use minheap... since in min heap the element at top
 would be the smallest and the ones below would
 be larger than that ...push elements in it and then
 pop elements from it when heap size > k ...
