To identify if stack would be used in a question , then
if you notice two loops i,j is being used ,
wherein j is dependent on i , i.e say: (j=0;j<i;...)
then think of using a stack ds....

We learned that heap could be used if top/max/min is asked
or if it feels that array is to be sorted...

Also for binary search we learned that if array sorted or
like nearly sorted, think of using B.S. concept....
