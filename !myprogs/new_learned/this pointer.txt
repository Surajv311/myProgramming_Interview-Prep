/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Every object in C++ has access to its own address through 
an important pointer called this pointer. 
The this pointer is an implicit parameter to 
all member functions. Therefore, inside a 
member function, this may be used to refer 
to the invoking object.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Friend functions do not have a this pointer, 
because friends are not members of a class. 
Only member functions have a this pointer.
